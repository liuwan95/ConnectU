Project Overview

Welcome to ConnectU, a semester-long project where you act as a Backend Engineer for a social media startup. By the end of the semester, you will have a fully functional text-based social network that handles users, posts, friendships, and algorithmic feeds using the data structures you learn in class.

**The Codebase**

You have been provided with connectu.cpp. This file contains the "shell" of the application:
- User Interface: A main menu loop.
- File I/O: Functions to load/save CSV files.
- Structs: Empty classes for you to fill in.


**The Dataset**

You are provided with three CSV files that serve as the database for the application. You do not need to parse these manually; the starter code handles the loading, but understanding the schema is important.

- users.csv: Contains user profiles and interest scores.
- relations.csv: Represents the social graph (who follows whom).
- posts.csv: Stores status updates.
